        Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you
        do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML example:
      </h1>
      <p>
        The process begins as the boxes of individual elements are laid out in
        such a way that any padding, border, or margin they happen to have is
        added to their content. This is what we call the box model. By default,
        a block-level element's content fills the available inline space of the
        parent element containing it, growing along the block dimension to
        accommodate its content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The size of inline-level elements is just the size of their content. You
        can set width or height on some elements that have a default display
        property value of inline, like &ltimg&gt, but display value will still
        remain inline. If you want to control the display property of an
        inline-level element in this manner, use CSS to set it to behave like a
        block-level element (e.g., with display: block; or display:
        inline-block;, which mixes characteristics from both). That explains how
        elements are structured individually, but how about the way they're
        structured when they interact with one another? The normal layout flow
        (mentioned in the layout introduction article) is the system by which
        elements are placed inside the browser's viewport. By default,
        block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, which is
        based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb). Each
        element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one
        separated by whatever margin that's been specified. In English, for
        example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode)
        block-level elements are laid out vertically. Inline elements behave
        differently. They don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on
        the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long
        as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block
        level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will
        move down to a new line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If two vertically adjacent elements both have a margin set on them and
        their margins touch, the larger of the two margins remains and the
        smaller one disappears. This is known as margin collapsing. Collapsing
        margins is only relevant in the vertical direction.
      </p>

          For many of the elements on your page, the normal flow will create
          exactly the layout you need. However, for more complex layouts you
          will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools
          available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML document
          is very important because you can then work with the way things are
          laid out by default rather than fighting against it. The methods that
          can change how elements are laid out in CSS are:
        </dl>
        <li>
          The display property — Standard values such as block, inline or
          inline-block can change how elements behave in normal flow, for
          example, by making a block-level element behave like an inline-level
          element (see Types of CSS boxes for more information). We also have
          entire layout methods that are enabled via specific display values,
          for example, CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how child elements are
          laid out inside their parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Floats — Applying a float value such as left can cause block-level
          elements to wrap along one side of an element, like the way images
          sometimes have text floating around them in magazine layouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          The position property — Allows you to precisely control the placement
          of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning is the default in
          normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently
          using other values, for example, as fixed to the top of the browser
          viewport.
        </li>
        <li>
          Table layout — Features designed for styling parts of an HTML table
          can be used on non-table elements using display: table and associated
          properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-column layout — The Multi-column layout properties can cause the
          content of a block to layout in columns, as you might see in a
          newspaper.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
