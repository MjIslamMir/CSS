            <h1>Working with Cascade, specificity, and inheritance</h1>
            <p>Often, the problem is that you create two rules that apply different 
                values of the same property to the same element. Cascade and 
                the closely-related concept of specificity are mechanisms that control 
                which rule applies when there is such a conflict. 
                The rule that's styling your element may not be the one you expect, 
                so you need to understand how these mechanisms work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also significant here is the concept of inheritance, which means that 
                some CSS properties by default inherit values set on the current element's 
                parent element and some don't. 
                This can also cause some behavior that you might not expect.

            <h1>Cascade</h1>
            <p>Stylesheets cascade — at a very simple level, this means that the origin, 
                the cascade layer, and the order of CSS rules matter. When two rules from 
                the same cascade layer apply and both have equal specificity, 
                the one that is defined last in the stylesheet is the one that will be used.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Specificity</h1>
            <p>
                Specificity is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is 
                applied to an element. If multiple style blocks have different selectors that 
                configure the same property with different values and target the same element, 
                specificity decides the property value that gets applied to the element. 
                Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An element selector is less specific; it will select all elements of that 
                    type that appear on a page, so it has less weight. 
                    Pseudo-element selectors have the same specificity as regular element selectors.
                </li>
                <li>A class selector is more specific; it will select only the elements on 
                    a page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more weight. 
                    Attribute selectors and pseudo-classes have the same weight as a class.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using three different values (or components), 
                which can be thought of as ID, CLASS, and ELEMENT columns in the hundreds, tens, and ones place:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifiers: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.
                </li>
                <li>Classes: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, 
                    or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.</li>
                <li>Score one in this column for each element selector or 
                    pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Inheritance</h1>
            <p>Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.

                For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, 
                every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, 
                unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them.
                Some properties do not inherit — for example, if you set a width of 50% on an element, 
                all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width. 
                If this was the case, CSS would be very frustrating to use!
            </p>
            <p>These three concepts (cascade, specificity, and inheritance) together control 
                which CSS applies to what element.
                It can sometimes seem a little bit complicated, 
                but you will start to remember them as you get more experienced with CSS</p>
