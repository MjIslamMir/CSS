        In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of 
        block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page 
        flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and 
        an outer display type.
        In general, you can set various values for the display type using the display property,
         which can have various values.
