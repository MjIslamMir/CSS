      <h1>Working With Media Queries</h1>
      <p>
        The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser
        and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example
        "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of
        responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts
        depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to
        detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for
        example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.
      </p>
      <p>The simplest media query syntax looks like this:</p>
      <p>
        <pre><code>@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
            /* CSS rules go here */
          }</code></pre>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <dl>It consists of:</dl>
        <li>A media type, which tells the browser what kind of media this code is for (e.g. print, or screen or all).</li>
        <li>A media expression, which is a rule, or test that must be passed for the contained CSS to be applied. eg width:600px</li>
        <li>A set of CSS rules that will be applied if the test passes and the media type is correct.</li>
        <li>Eg: <pre><code>@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (orientation: landscape) {
            body {
              color: blue;
            }
          }</code></pre></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
